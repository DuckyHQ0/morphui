# MorphUI

## v0.3-beta

A modern, open source React UI kit for DuckyHQ projects.

Figma design file with components, styles, and design documentation is [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1322693203140901897/morphui-wip).

### Project

This project uses React, Storybook, Vite, and Tailwind. To run the Storybook your self, use `pnpm storybook`. Components, stories, and Tailwind theming stuff are all in the `src` directory.

### Installation

This will soon be an npm module. Right now, you can copy the Tailwind files and components your self.

### Tailwind Info

The spacing system is literal, so `p-32` equals exactly 32 pixels: `padding: 32px;`.
