# MorphUI

A cool UI kit.

### How this project works

This is using Next.js, and Storybook. You're gonna wanna use `npm run storybook` to start the dev server. All the components are inside the components folder. And the stories are separate, in the stories folder.

### Installation for your own projects

This will not be an NPM module. What you have to do is get this source code (clone, or download zip), then copy the Tailwind input file (/app/globals.css), the Tailwind config (tailwind.config.ts), then the entire components folder, all into your own project, replacing the old files.
